## The Library

This is a React App showcasing my personal recommended reading lists. Additional technologies include a Redux Tooklit store and data fetch through the Google Books API. It features multiple bookshelves divided by topic matter alongside an integrated book reader.

These are the titles that have impacted my thinking, understanding and enjoyment of the world.
